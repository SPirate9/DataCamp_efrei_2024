Odokata,1,"The matches make no sense, it's unbalanced and often very unfair (I don't care about losing honestly... But you have to see the face of the Decks your opponents use) and especially...

Of course everyone will take Novice, including the rats who will be happy to destroy you with their 2000+ cards as well as an ultra rare Full Art card that inflicts 150 damage or more.  
  
They should introduce a system that would allow us to face players based on the win/loss ratio, something like that, or the game should make us face players who use borrowed Decks if we use a borrowed Deck ourselves and vice versa if we use a Deck built ourselves or with the help of the game... because for now, it's crazy.  
  
I am a Novice myself, I just collect cards in real life but I never fight, I thought this game could be a good way to start.

PlasmaPony,1,"I started playing on global launch and am already bored. I’ve had some good packs and have at last 1 of most of the set, but now that’s part of the problem. The game is so stingy with some of the rare cards as well as crafting currency that opening packs is always disappointing as it’s just duplicates all the way down. Needing 50 packs to craft one rare card when you get two, maybe three packs a day is nuts. Battles are also very tedious. Everyone is playing the same 3 decks. Pikachu, Articuno and Mewtwo. The game always feels decided on the mulligan. EX cards are way too strong. With only three points to win there is no real drawback to playing a deck of them. I was excited to start playing but once the novelty wore it got boring really fast. Once the free subscription trial ends I’m gonna uninstall","I started playing on global launch and am already bored.

Its also easy to get a good deck early on and the only reason im playing a lot right now is to get the badges from the event thing they have.

MeiMeilyn,1,"Having a lot of bad luck playing the game which no ones fault but it added a lot of bad experience, and pulling the card was meh I haven't got anything beside a venusaur EX, I would rather it be like duel links where you pull card from a box so at least you guarantee to got one you want, since I only have venusaur okay I will make a grass deck which is fine but then in realized I need another 500 for a venusaur, the other card that I can craft was also not cheap no structure deck either, try online you could guess what happen coin flipping simulator. 

I hope the game gets better over time, it's still new so I will hold my judgement against it.

The game part of it is a waste of time and not really worth playing; Live, for all its bugs, offers a more complete experience that is free to play and lets you bling out your decks.

After you hit the two week mark, and the packs drop off rapidly, the weaknesses in the game become very apparent. I want to get the immersive Mew and I’m probably done with it.","Its okay.

GrowlingOcelot_4516,1,"I used to be more a collector as a kid, and didn't quite understand the battles.
I rediscover collecting Pokemon cards, but in a new way. 
You'd think playing with 20 cards would be easy, but the composition and right combination makes it quite strategic. Easier than MTG, but hard enough.
It's fast paced and low maintenance. I got bored of Pokemon Unite because it became a chore to login everyday. Here, I login once or twice a day, play as many battles as I want, mess with my decks, and that's it. It feels nice to come back to.

I still feel there is room for improvements though. Like some rewards feel a bit useless.
I prefer to open packs, even if I get crappy draws, but at least I'm opening packs.
Past the initial beginner rewards, it slows down drastically and I get very little chances to complete my deck, even with premium.

I should have checked deck builds and open 2/3 of my boosters into the booster type I needed.","I used to be more a collector as a kid, and didn't quite understand the battles.

Because I spent like 60$ and literally didn’t even pull a single ex card only got 2 regular holos. But from free packs I’ve pulled gold pikachu. RNG on them coins are terrible.

I like it is quick and simple but i would also like to see a 5 point match type introduce to allow a more in depth game for those who want it. Right now it is just drop your ex turn 1 and try to KO their EX. By the time you have one ex built the game is near over. With some exceptions. 

We need more than a versus mode too, a quick story mode or something would be nice. Or events that have a story. 

Didn’t even know there was a event til i check the wonder pick. 

But this is just week 1 so i give it another 2-3 months to judge it critically.","I agree for the first few days but now after completing the missions and opening all the packs from level 1-10 its getting boring.

151 is great because it’s the original 151 Pokémon so there’s lots of names ya know. But it is expensive lol. 

Pokémon TCG have a website where you can go through every set and find out what’s in each one to help you make the decision, and then Collectr is a great place to figure out the worth of the cards you pull!

However, I would argue, Pokémon hasn't always been that way (and in some ways still isn't). The spin off games for example, aren't cash grabs and most are better than the main line recycled stuff you're talking about.

Samuawesome,78,"I just wish there was more to do tbh. It really does emphasize the ""collectors"" part of the TCG.

The reason why I've mainly played Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links over Master Duel is because Master Duel doesn't have much solo content. Once you finish the tutorial and the challenge PVE content, the main bulk of the game is PVP. At least with Duel Links, I can log in every now and then to fight the Vagabonds to scratch that itch.

Pokemon Pocket TCG is the same where once you're done with the limited solo play stuff, there's only PVP left.

Gilchester,46,"The ""first play is a disadvantage"" argument *feels* accurate, but no one has yet shown any data this is true. Going first means you can evolve a pokemon first, which can be a big deal. Misty decks can also cheese a win basically turn one without counterplay. There is also so much other rng in the game, I doubt going first is a massive determinant. 

I am sure DENA has the internal data on going first win rates, and I'd guess it's no worse than like 45% for going first (for comparison, chess has between a 48 and 44% chance of winning going second). One of the turns will be disadvantaged, and I'd guess that in the past paced environment like this, doing what you can normally do in the TCG would lead to a big win rate for going first, and this is actually a decent way to do it. Until someone shows me data that going first has a win rate <45%, I'm not nearly as worried about it as most people seem to be.","The ""first play is a disadvantage"" argument *feels* accurate, but no one has yet shown any data this is true.

dominodave,2,"I'm going to use this thread to share my first impressions too.  Overall I think the concept of collecting the cards in manner like this is fun, I like that a lot.  That said I think the core battling gameplay is terrible, that is to say a terrible fit for this game.

I think the original Pokemon TCG and its current corresponding app TCG Live captures the full extent of the modern game in digital form, including in all it's slow paced long and time consuming glory (I did prefer TCGO with its trading but that's another story).  I think wanting to make a faster paced version of that game using the same cards is a great idea.

That said, this game just randomly splits the game up while making really weird choices in order to both maintain the previous design style, while going into a new one.  20 cards for a deck, almost all pokemon, very few supporters and items and very limited utility.  The energy system kind of sucks and is unreliable, and matches still take forever.  Deck building is kind of a joke now, I don't even know why this game really exists as it is.

But collecting the cards is still fun.  I wish they would have gone much further with the changes, maybe making it to be a bit more like Marvel Snap or the late Pokemon Duel.  Also all the animations and notifications and animations and effects take way too damn long.  They really should have reinvented the game at a much more fundamental level.  I had some ideas but it's only a loose concept.  It honestly should have just been a really fast-paced auto-battler mode where it's pretty cut and dry in terms of using the card mechanics.  Using the auto function in the game is awful, the ai makes the worst decisions.

Also the timer needs to be reduced from 20 minutes each to 5 min each tops.","I'm going to use this thread to share my first impressions too.

Blain/Rapid/Ninetails rush
Corner/poison
Firebird Ramp

You will see pretty much these decks and nothing else. Primarily Pika, Mewtwo, and Misty. 

The RNG factor is so strong that you kinda know what's going to happen by turn 2. Misty players are the worst. Zero gameplay, all RNG. Pika is damn hard to play into with just about anything except the Rapidash rush. MewTwo is close behind it. 

There just isn't enough variation right this moment, and RNG plays far too much a factor. I think the meta will grow and develop as expansions drop, but right now it's pretty lackluster.

MilkyPieAintYummy,1,"I gave it a try, and I've been a F2P my whole life. Sure I didn't read much of your review but here's my take as a F2P. Also, I've never been in the card collecting ever so I don't really know much about TCGs.


Is it F2P friendly? No, not it the slightest bit at all. I just started, collected enough cards to build a deck, did some Solo and I'm like ""This is pretty neat, they've done a good job in this."", and went and try versus and instantly, matched with someone 10 levels higher, now that's ass balancing.
Basically, more levels = more card packs opened, more possibilities for deck building. I lost that match, its ok, I can play again it doesn't cost energy to play anyway but then... Consecutive matches with opponents way above my league so I figured ""Maybe I ought to do Solos and open more packs?"" So I did. First matches in there gives Exp, on top with opening packs and soon, my level caught up with them. I started versus again, hey look, we're on the same level... 
But then you realize your deck sucks ass... And your opponent has multiple EX its crazy. Out of 50 matches I've done, you know how much I've won? 7 times, and that's against F2Ps or other players who just started.


It might be possible for F2Ps to reach that level similar to P2Ws but that's either you have insane lucks with your card pack openings, or you take months to build a deck that'll be obsolete once new Meta decks appear.","I gave it a try, and I've been a F2P my whole life.

Lpunit,1,"I think you've got a good analysis.

I do just want to point out something regarding the P2W aspect. EVERY TCG you will ever play is going to be P2W. However, a TCG, and especially this TCG-lite, are so much less P2W than what a typical gacha gamer will think of when they think ""P2W"".

You can probably drop like $50 and get one of the meta decks outright. It is P2W by definition but it is way, way cheaper if you really care about always winning PvP (it really doesn't matter) than pretty much any other game on the market. 

IMO, the app is at it's best if you treat it as a collector only that you log into once a day for a few minutes to look at your pretty stuff. It's also a good stepping stone game if you've never played a TCG before and want an easy one to try out.

However, a TCG, and especially this TCG-lite, are so much less P2W than what a typical gacha gamer will think of when they think ""P2W"". You can probably drop like $50 and get one of the meta decks outright. It is P2W by definition but it is way, way cheaper if you really care about always winning PvP (it really doesn't matter) than pretty much any other game on the market.

FargoFuckYaSelf,0,"tl;dr I surprisingly love this game right now. 

I started the game three days ago. Intending on staying free to play, but I'm using the free trial now. I haven't looked up decks because I don't want to, and I've done everything possible to open packs without spending money (did all the solos and bought all the store hourglasses with those store points). I doubt I have a meta deck, but I'm surprisingly happy with my Fighting deck. 

Fuck Charizard/Venusaur/Blastoise EX decks. I actually think Mewtwo and Pikachu are more fair than those three, and I hate the other three so much that I'm happy looking for ways to destroy them with other types. 

Going first vs going second absolutely needs to be rebalanced. I'm on the side of letting both sides collect energy in the first round, and then allow attacks on the second round.

One tiny little nitpick I have is the battle music. It just sounds too similar to the menu music. Having a higher energy battle theme, or even getting to choose remixes of battle themes, would be amazing.","tl;dr I surprisingly love this game right now. I started the game three days ago.

Generic music.

No pve (except for the 20 or something levels against predefined decks)

No ranked system.

Basic visuals.

Unclear interface, I read some people that didn't even realize that you CAN level up to level three instantly with the rewards you get.

No reward for loosing games.

No extra modes.

They just barely recently added something more ""interactive"" with the lapras event.

No customization.

The game is basically a simulator of opening packs.

I'm judging the game as someone who plays or has played hearthstone, legends of runeterra, yugioh, eternal, gwent and Kards.

The Pokémon franchise has infinite potential but once again their laziness shows up.

And the answer to everything is ""well I like the way it is"" or ""it is what it is, enjoy or leave"" at least in their subreddit and discord.

Asyelum,1,"This is pretty much backwards lol.

The progression is WAY to fast at the beginning intentionally to allow you to almost build alot of decks and then trickle in cards to you, this is an attempt to get you buy boosters.

You hit this point on about day 2 and then your only F2P option for additional packs is leveling up which takes forever.

So after day 2 if your not going to spend any money don't expect much progress aside from logging in once or twice a day for a pack.

Aside from that the way their premium is setup is very scammy, Free 2 week trail that resubs on a game with less than a week of playtime for most people will translate to a sizable portion of people paying for that and not realizing until after.

This game will become only increasingly money hungry until even it's most fervent addicts are done.  As much as I looked forward to this game I don't see it lasting more than a year.","This is pretty much backwards lol.

Jakad,5,"> have an account worth $60 after 30 days. You can’t do that with any other card game

What is this supposed to even mean? Have an account worth $60? Are you suggesting that each pack opened on an account is worth $1? Even if that where true, which it is not, how can the same not be said for any other game with micro transactions? It's like saying every 10 pull I've done in a gacha game increases the value of the account by $20 dollars, because that's how much it would have cost to do that 10 pull if you spent money on it.

The ""value"" of the account is determined not by how many packs you have opened or how many cards you have, but WHICH cards you have. To a player, an account that has Mewtwo deck, Pika deck, Starmie deck, and Charizard deck, all complete is valued higher than someone who may have more total open packs but with less relevant cards. Suggesting that somehow the cards I have gotten while f2p in MTGA, or Shadowverse, or Hearthstone, or Pokemon TCG Live aren't ""worth"" anything but the cards I have in Pocket are worth something, just don't make any sense. 

It's absolutely disgusting to see these content creators drop $100+ USD on the game a DAY and then talk about how fun it is. when in reality if they were free to play they would AT MOST have 1 complete deck and that's IF they got super lucky or rerolled for it.  If they where like me and playing a Starmie deck with 1 Staryu and no Sabrinas, and doing their 2 packs a day on Pika packs because the deck they really want to play is Raichu, but they have 0 raichu and 0 pika ex, do you think they would be having fun with their garbage decks when they just get rolled by people who have completed viable decks? 

I'm continuing to play begrudgingly because I would like to complete my starmie deck one day, and I would like to get the Raichu deck. But the pace as which I can make progress towards these it's abysmally, unenjoyingly slow and something I haven't experienced in any other digital TCG.","> have an account worth $60 after 30 days.

Once you finish all events / story / 1 time rewards in pocket, you will see how it is just like every other gacha game.

Personally i think having 3 different banners (packs) on release is a huge L for pocket. They should make basic prints of every card way easier to access and just make special arts way rarer. Either that or cut in half the number of medals needed to craft a card.

Bien sr il y a les plus jeunes ou impatients qui dpensent tous les boosters gratuits du dbut et ensuite se plaignent de n'en avoir plus aucun  ouvrir au bout de deux trois jours. Je joue depuis plusieurs semaines et j'ai de quoi m'amuser. Le jeu n'a pas vocation  ce que le joueur y passe deux heures par jour, c'est un petit truc sur le ct o tu peux amliorer ta collection et faire quelques combats si a t'amuse. C'est un petit truc fun.

Peacebomber,3,"Je suis assez mitigé, j'aime bien ouvrir des booster, mais passé la pluie de boosters offerts le premier jour (les 2-3 premiers si vous prenez votre temps) après c'est un peu long d'obtenir des cartes

Ils ont deux événements en cours, le premier est d'une pauvreté incroyable, le deuxième est un peu plus sympa mais demande d'avoir déjà un certain nombre de cartes (la quantité de boosters offert au début permet de les avoir largement) pour être faisable entièrement 

Le système de combat est simple, je ne sais pas si il suit les mêmes règles que le jeu normal ou si il a été simplifié pour rentrer sur mobile vu que je n'y ai jamais joué.


Je pense que c'est un jeu qui occupera les curieux occasionnels pendant 1 à 2 semaines max avant que l'assechement des booster gratuits et la flemme du ""farming"" quotidien ne se fasse sentir.
Pour les fans de pokémon peut-être que ça prendra un peu plus de temps et les fan de tcg ont sûrement mieux sur le marché et ont probablement déjà passé leur chemin.

steelsauce,45,"Game is very polished and fun for what it is- but won’t be for everyone. 

You get two free packs of 5 cards per day. That’s enough to build a good deck in a week or two. I’ve been playing the soft launch this past month, and have two top meta decks and complete a decent amount of the collection. 

Battle is currently not the main focus- seems to be collecting instead. In the future there will be ranked mode and battle events so we’ll see. Battles are much simplified compared to regular TCG, even from the original base set. Games are quick. 

Very easy learning curve even for someone who hasn’t played a TCG before. Hope to see more events and complexity and trading down the line!","Game is very polished and fun for what it is- but wont be for everyone. You get two free packs of 5 cards per day.

CouchPoturtle,4,"It’s well presented but feels really underbaked.

The cards don’t look as nice as Marvel Snap and don’t make use of the gyroscope, so they feel ‘flat’ on the screen and you have to move them around with your finger.

There appears to be an upgrade mechanic for duplicates but it seems like it only adds a little sparkle effect to the card. Nothing like Marvel Snap where they become 3D and animated.

It doesn’t explain the rarity scale for those new to Pokémon cards.

It didn’t launch with trading and the battles are extremely basic.

So, a good start I guess but not really any substance to it right now.","Its well presented but feels really underbaked.
