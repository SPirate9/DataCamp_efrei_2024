You leave the shop, because there really isn't much to do with the cards you've just paid for. You realise you'd need to buy the shop to compete with the guys in the shop. And then you realise you are the only guy in the shop left. You don't want these cards. They were expensive, but they have 0 use.

Commentaire : The matches make no sense, it's unbalanced and often very unfair (I don't care about losing honestly... But you have to see the face of the Decks your opponents use) and especially... I would like to focus my attention on the possibility of choosing the "battle mode", Novice or Specialist... I mean... Of course everyone will take Novice, including the rats who will be happy to destroy you with their 2000+ cards as well as an ultra rare Full Art card that inflicts 150 damage or more.  
  
They should introduce a system that would allow us to face players based on the win/loss ratio, something like that, or the game should make us face players who use borrowed Decks if we use a borrowed Deck ourselves and vice versa if we use a Deck built ourselves or with the help of the game... because for now, it's crazy.  
  
I am a Novice myself, I just collect cards in real life but I never fight, I thought this game could be a good way to start.  
  
Especially since you have some kind of "tryharder" who constantly reroll their account in order to have the best cards... besides, it's also a problem, why do we have this possibility?  
  
In short, quite disappointed with the game at the moment.

Commentaire : PvP is horrible. It's basically a luckfest based on type advantage and how lucky you were with your rips and wonderpicks. I mean, if you simply didn't find several good supporter cards so far, don't even bother with PvP, because you get steamrolled. And even then you have to pray that the opponent didn't find a totally OP Ex card that will rip your whole deck apart, unless you happened to open a counter and you also included it in your deck.

And don't even let me start how ridiculously determining the opening hand is. Your opponent managed to pull an Ex Pokemon and you only have some basics? Well, good luck getting back from THAT disadvantage.

Commentaire : I started playing on global launch and am already bored. I’ve had some good packs and have at last 1 of most of the set, but now that’s part of the problem. The game is so stingy with some of the rare cards as well as crafting currency that opening packs is always disappointing as it’s just duplicates all the way down. Needing 50 packs to craft one rare card when you get two, maybe three packs a day is nuts. Battles are also very tedious. Everyone is playing the same 3 decks. Pikachu, Articuno and Mewtwo. The game always feels decided on the mulligan. EX cards are way too strong. With only three points to win there is no real drawback to playing a deck of them. I was excited to start playing but once the novelty wore it got boring really fast. Once the free subscription trial ends I’m gonna uninstall

Commentaire : Yes and no. It streamlines the gameplay of the card game and only has a limited amount of cards. Streamlining it makes you kinda miss manually playing the game or playing tcg live as it has less thought to it, but you can jump in and learn pretty easily. The amount of cards is limited so there's no sensory overload of what to pick for a deck, you can also auto set decks. That will change in the future as more cards are added, but it just plays into the gacha aspect. This game wants your money, really badly. Which is terrible in any case. I'd say just play tcg live.

Commentaire : $100 is nothing in a mobile game. In another mobile game called Genshin Impact, I have probably spent upwards of $1,000 in total which is also nothing(dolphin spender). People are willing to spend money even if it's a mobile game if they enjoy it and plan to play it for quite some time. It's better than buying desktop games on Steam when it goes on sale and you end up filling a whole backlog without touching them.

True mobile gamers spend upwards of $10k+(whales).

Then you got all of the Eastern market where people spent can spend even more than that without even batting an eye.

I'll most likely spend another $100 when discounted game currency becomes available again to buy new booster packs to make more fun Pokemon decks to pvp or just to trade with other players in game(nonexistent feature with digital TCG and gacha games in general) or sell rare cards for RMT(real money transactions).

Commentaire : I'm very conflicted about it. On the one hand, I really do feel motivated to log in every day to open boosters. The full arts look absolutely gorgeous and it feel so very satisfying to open one.

On the other hand, I'm really not motivated to stay for the gameplay.

I feel like it's oversimplifying the tcg to a point where the battles are very dull. Like, gameplay wise I would much rather just play TCGO, I think that's a much better way to experience the card game.

Pocket doesn't take advantage at all of the fact that it's a digital-only card game. If we are relating strictly to mobile, fast-paced card games, in a world where Marvel Snap exists, there's no way I would pick Pocket over Snap.

It’s like why I hate Warzone - at any point, they can just reset your stuff, or stop supporting it and make a new version that all which you bought no longer works or exists on.

The game part of it is a waste of time and not really worth playing; Live, for all its bugs, offers a more complete experience that is free to play and lets you bling out your decks. 

Otherwise, it’s a pretty looking pack opening simulator. The fact that the main reason to gain EXP, is to get 12 hour glasses, so that you can open another pack says it all. Even the ‘event’ at the moment is just a wonder pick. 

After you hit the two week mark, and the packs drop off rapidly, the weaknesses in the game become very apparent. I want to get the immersive Mew and I’m probably done with it.

Commentaire : I used to be more a collector as a kid, and didn't quite understand the battles.
I rediscover collecting Pokemon cards, but in a new way. 
You'd think playing with 20 cards would be easy, but the composition and right combination makes it quite strategic. Easier than MTG, but hard enough.
It's fast paced and low maintenance. I got bored of Pokemon Unite because it became a chore to login everyday. Here, I login once or twice a day, play as many battles as I want, mess with my decks, and that's it. It feels nice to come back to.

I still feel there is room for improvements though. Like some rewards feel a bit useless.
I prefer to open packs, even if I get crappy draws, but at least I'm opening packs.
Past the initial beginner rewards, it slows down drastically and I get very little chances to complete my deck, even with premium.

I should have checked deck builds and open 2/3 of my boosters into the booster type I needed.

If jynx at the start options are available to use energy on it. Don't be afraid to switch dudes out and back in.

Time IS money as well as relying on RNG (let alone the fact that you have to buy 'Pokegold' to even use RNG or wait 12 freaking hours to open a pack.

Gardevoir’s ability let’s you keep feeding energy to your mewtwo EX, so you can use his 150 damage move (which loses 2 energy) nonstop. 1 energy from the pool, one from Gardevoir’s ability.

Commentaire : I just wish there was more to do tbh. It really does emphasize the "collectors" part of the TCG.

The reason why I've mainly played Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links over Master Duel is because Master Duel doesn't have much solo content. Once you finish the tutorial and the challenge PVE content, the main bulk of the game is PVP. At least with Duel Links, I can log in every now and then to fight the Vagabonds to scratch that itch.

Pokemon Pocket TCG is the same where once you're done with the limited solo play stuff, there's only PVP left. The Lapras event is nice and all, but the stamina to do it recharges so slowly.

Commentaire : The "first play is a disadvantage" argument *feels* accurate, but no one has yet shown any data this is true. Going first means you can evolve a pokemon first, which can be a big deal. Misty decks can also cheese a win basically turn one without counterplay. There is also so much other rng in the game, I doubt going first is a massive determinant. 

I am sure DENA has the internal data on going first win rates, and I'd guess it's no worse than like 45% for going first (for comparison, chess has between a 48 and 44% chance of winning going second). One of the turns will be disadvantaged, and I'd guess that in the past paced environment like this, doing what you can normally do in the TCG would lead to a big win rate for going first, and this is actually a decent way to do it. Until someone shows me data that going first has a win rate <45%, I'm not nearly as worried about it as most people seem to be.

And no, you actually don't need EX Pokemon for ladder, I use my own deck with no EX to get the final reward in this battle event, there is plenty of non EX deck too in youtube that perform well.

Commentaire : I'm going to use this thread to share my first impressions too.  Overall I think the concept of collecting the cards in manner like this is fun, I like that a lot.  That said I think the core battling gameplay is terrible, that is to say a terrible fit for this game.

I think the original Pokemon TCG and its current corresponding app TCG Live captures the full extent of the modern game in digital form, including in all it's slow paced long and time consuming glory (I did prefer TCGO with its trading but that's another story).  I think wanting to make a faster paced version of that game using the same cards is a great idea.

That said, this game just randomly splits the game up while making really weird choices in order to both maintain the previous design style, while going into a new one.  20 cards for a deck, almost all pokemon, very few supporters and items and very limited utility.  The energy system kind of sucks and is unreliable, and matches still take forever.  Deck building is kind of a joke now, I don't even know why this game really exists as it is.

But collecting the cards is still fun.  I wish they would have gone much further with the changes, maybe making it to be a bit more like Marvel Snap or the late Pokemon Duel.  Also all the animations and notifications and animations and effects take way too damn long.  They really should have reinvented the game at a much more fundamental level.  I had some ideas but it's only a loose concept.  It honestly should have just been a really fast-paced auto-battler mode where it's pretty cut and dry in terms of using the card mechanics.  Using the auto function in the game is awful, the ai makes the worst decisions.

Also the timer needs to be reduced from 20 minutes each to 5 min each tops.

You will see pretty much these decks and nothing else. Primarily Pika, Mewtwo, and Misty. 

The RNG factor is so strong that you kinda know what's going to happen by turn 2. Misty players are the worst. Zero gameplay, all RNG. Pika is damn hard to play into with just about anything except the Rapidash rush. MewTwo is close behind it. 

There just isn't enough variation right this moment, and RNG plays far too much a factor. I think the meta will grow and develop as expansions drop, but right now it's pretty lackluster. I've done just about everything there is to do right now.

So when people say it feels slow for the mobile version in terms of the pack opening rate, they don’t realize you had to go spend 5$ to get an IRL pack before you could get any cards in game. 

It also adhered to the rules of TCG more strictly and was more or less a virtual simulation of Pokémon cards. The mobile game feels watered down and faster paced(which isn’t always a bad thing). I think different styles of play and more quests/events would do the game well.

Commentaire : I gave it a try, and I've been a F2P my whole life. Sure I didn't read much of your review but here's my take as a F2P. Also, I've never been in the card collecting ever so I don't really know much about TCGs.


Is it F2P friendly? No, not it the slightest bit at all. I just started, collected enough cards to build a deck, did some Solo and I'm like "This is pretty neat, they've done a good job in this.", and went and try versus and instantly, matched with someone 10 levels higher, now that's ass balancing.
Basically, more levels = more card packs opened, more possibilities for deck building. I lost that match, its ok, I can play again it doesn't cost energy to play anyway but then... Consecutive matches with opponents way above my league so I figured "Maybe I ought to do Solos and open more packs?" So I did. First matches in there gives Exp, on top with opening packs and soon, my level caught up with them. I started versus again, hey look, we're on the same level... 
But then you realize your deck sucks ass... And your opponent has multiple EX its crazy. Out of 50 matches I've done, you know how much I've won? 7 times, and that's against F2Ps or other players who just started.


It might be possible for F2Ps to reach that level similar to P2Ws but that's either you have insane lucks with your card pack openings, or you take months to build a deck that'll be obsolete once new Meta decks appear.

Commentaire : I think you've got a good analysis.

I do just want to point out something regarding the P2W aspect. EVERY TCG you will ever play is going to be P2W. However, a TCG, and especially this TCG-lite, are so much less P2W than what a typical gacha gamer will think of when they think "P2W".

You can probably drop like $50 and get one of the meta decks outright. It is P2W by definition but it is way, way cheaper if you really care about always winning PvP (it really doesn't matter) than pretty much any other game on the market. 

IMO, the app is at it's best if you treat it as a collector only that you log into once a day for a few minutes to look at your pretty stuff. It's also a good stepping stone game if you've never played a TCG before and want an easy one to try out.

I started the game three days ago. Intending on staying free to play, but I'm using the free trial now. I haven't looked up decks because I don't want to, and I've done everything possible to open packs without spending money (did all the solos and bought all the store hourglasses with those store points). I doubt I have a meta deck, but I'm surprisingly happy with my Fighting deck. 

Fuck Charizard/Venusaur/Blastoise EX decks. I actually think Mewtwo and Pikachu are more fair than those three, and I hate the other three so much that I'm happy looking for ways to destroy them with other types. 

Going first vs going second absolutely needs to be rebalanced. I'm on the side of letting both sides collect energy in the first round, and then allow attacks on the second round.

One tiny little nitpick I have is the battle music. It just sounds too similar to the menu music. Having a higher energy battle theme, or even getting to choose remixes of battle themes, would be amazing.

Commentaire : you don't need data to realise the only card that do not lose going first is Rapidash wich is an evolve so you need to actualy lose (or win lol) coinflip and then just draw those 2 card, ez bro.

And you know what the best part of the story ? Farfetch do it for free with any element as a base mon wich start destroying the oponent turn 1 if you did start second.

Also data will be screwed since this game is a big coinflip (litteraly) at every turn, so unless there is 2 billions game per day it could go 30/70 or whatever genshin pitty rate is for the average player.

They should give you even a minimal xp if you lost but sticked on the battle until the end. :( would encourage me to play off meta decks if I knew even if I don't win I'll still get something out of it.

Commentaire : Totally agree with you in only locking cosmetic to ranked - keeping progression rewards accessible off-ladder. Having more rewards for PvP and Solo is sorely needed though - the pack dripfeed does not help this game much.

That is true - EX decks are certainly beatable without playing a meta deck, but it’s still frustrating to hit the same three decks over and over again in PvP if you have a smaller selection of cards.

Commentaire : Idk if “glorified” is accurate. I’m the adult enjoying the nostalgia at $10 a month for 2++ packs a day with casual battles with my wife and friends VS $5+ a physical pack ($35++ a month at the same rip rate) and virtually zero battles a month. 

I’m not seeing the glorification, but I am seeing the cheap nostalgic entertainment. 

Also, I’m not making an argument so much as shining light on the silver lining for the apps purpose. I do miss the old live app, I scanned SO many cards and had killer decks and now it’s all just gone. But with 2 kids and a full time job… this is actually kind of better. Less META and more ripping packs.

Generic music.

No pve (except for the 20 or something levels against predefined decks)

No ranked system.

Basic visuals.

Unclear interface, I read some people that didn't even realize that you CAN level up to level three instantly with the rewards you get.

No reward for loosing games.

No extra modes.

They just barely recently added something more "interactive" with the lapras event.

No customization.

The game is basically a simulator of opening packs.

I'm judging the game as someone who plays or has played hearthstone, legends of runeterra, yugioh, eternal, gwent and Kards.

The Pokémon franchise has infinite potential but once again their laziness shows up.

And the answer to everything is "well I like the way it is" or "it is what it is, enjoy or leave" at least in their subreddit and discord.

But I don't mind if people like the game or spends 800 dollars, but again I don't see it as a serious competitor to these games I mentioned (and I didn't mentioned marvel snap or magic because haven't played them) those games aren't perfect neither but at least they don't feel like we're made with the bare minimum in mind.

The problem with this game right now is that if you want to get all the rewards from events (both PVE and PVP) you need a good deck. It is hard to built a deck as a new players in pokemon tcg cause you need to wait 12 hours to pull 5 useless duplicat cards. I had played runeterra, hearthstone and gwent. Runeterra and gwent is much more generous, i can build a deck in less than a week and use it to climb to highest rank with new account. 

 I give up playing new PVP events after i got 16 wins cause i'm tired of facing against mewtwo and pikachu deck every game. For PVE lapras event, i'm lucky i got 1 pikachu ex card so i just slap some random ass lighting monster in to a deck and hope i draw pikachu before the ai draw starmie ex (free retreat, 2 energy for 90 damage, 130 hp.

You automatically get free viable decks, code cards are given away en masse by TCG collectors who will never play, and crafting mats are plentiful. Sure, it’s meant to get people into the physical cards, it looks ass, and is buggy, but everything is extremely accessible
 
PTCGP is a bit too slow. I’m five days in and already at the point of open two packs and end the day because there is nothing interesting to do. The TCG side is kinda dull and you can usually tell who has won by turn 3, so it’s scoop or win by that point. Not my thing, personally. 

As for the gacha side, it’s fine. Middle of the road as far as gacha goes, and I’m 14 years deep in the gacha hole. I remember the days when pity systems didn’t exist and people were regularly spending hundreds for a single card.

I've been pulling mainly from the pikachu pack and im missing 1 Blastoise EX i want and both Pikachu+Zapdos EX cards. I only have 330 pack points so i cant get those cards for quite some time.

Commentaire : Way too early to tell. Vast majority of the cards aren't rare so unlocking over 50% or whatever you said isn't impressive at all. Wonder picks can't contain the rarest cards which I think is kind of a bummer imo. At the rate I've been completing my dex here lately as a pure f2p I don't think there's a snowballs chance in hell that I complete sets before they go out of rotation which is also kind of a bummer.

 It's not all bad though,  I enjoy the simplicity of the app and opening my 2 packs a day is a lot of fun. I'm not really into the card battles so I pretty much just open packs and wanna complete sets so maybe once full launch happens and we get some events going perhaps I'll have a better shot at completing sets but the way the game is now, it's a fun little thing to do but as far as being "free to play done right"? There's nothing that really stands out to me. Seems like your regular f2p battle pass macrotransaction mobile game. I think packs are way too expensive as well if you're going to spend money. In other words, if you are going to spend I'd rather do it on a game that feels like you're getting your money's worth and the amount of packs you can open per real $ spent is not good imo.

The progression is WAY to fast at the beginning intentionally to allow you to almost build alot of decks and then trickle in cards to you, this is an attempt to get you buy boosters.

You hit this point on about day 2 and then your only F2P option for additional packs is leveling up which takes forever.

So after day 2 if your not going to spend any money don't expect much progress aside from logging in once or twice a day for a pack.

Aside from that the way their premium is setup is very scammy, Free 2 week trail that resubs on a game with less than a week of playtime for most people will translate to a sizable portion of people paying for that and not realizing until after.

This game will become only increasingly money hungry until even it's most fervent addicts are done.  As much as I looked forward to this game I don't see it lasting more than a year.

Commentaire : It's the worst digital TCG I've ever played for f2p deck building. 

I want to build Pika ex/Raichu deck. I'm 70 packs opened (probably 60 pika ex?) with NO pika ex or raichu found. You get too few pack points or cards cost to many pack points. 

As f2p you get to pity select 1 (ONE) Pokemon ex every month and a half. F2P done right. Please. Never in my life have I played a digital card game where I either had to get luckly or wait 3 months to build 1 deck of my choice and that's assuming the deck you're trying to build is only using 2 exs.

Those who spend can have nicer-looking cards, while free players still get cards that perform the same. That seems like a fair balance. And who knows maybe those daily packs gives you one of those shiny things for free.

Trying to get the new card each week is exhausting, especially when you miss out on Spotlight caches. As a free-to-play player in Marvel Snap, you’re looking at years just to unlock the good cards. A Series 5 card alone takes around 3 months of grinding 6000 tokens—and that’s for just one. Maybe the only reason why Pokémon TCG feels different is because they don’t have months/years of previously release cards?

Commentaire : > have an account worth $60 after 30 days. You can’t do that with any other card game

What is this supposed to even mean? Have an account worth $60? Are you suggesting that each pack opened on an account is worth $1? Even if that where true, which it is not, how can the same not be said for any other game with micro transactions? It's like saying every 10 pull I've done in a gacha game increases the value of the account by $20 dollars, because that's how much it would have cost to do that 10 pull if you spent money on it.

The "value" of the account is determined not by how many packs you have opened or how many cards you have, but WHICH cards you have. To a player, an account that has Mewtwo deck, Pika deck, Starmie deck, and Charizard deck, all complete is valued higher than someone who may have more total open packs but with less relevant cards. Suggesting that somehow the cards I have gotten while f2p in MTGA, or Shadowverse, or Hearthstone, or Pokemon TCG Live aren't "worth" anything but the cards I have in Pocket are worth something, just don't make any sense. 

It's absolutely disgusting to see these content creators drop $100+ USD on the game a DAY and then talk about how fun it is. when in reality if they were free to play they would AT MOST have 1 complete deck and that's IF they got super lucky or rerolled for it.  If they where like me and playing a Starmie deck with 1 Staryu and no Sabrinas, and doing their 2 packs a day on Pika packs because the deck they really want to play is Raichu, but they have 0 raichu and 0 pika ex, do you think they would be having fun with their garbage decks when they just get rolled by people who have completed viable decks? 

I'm continuing to play begrudgingly because I would like to complete my starmie deck one day, and I would like to get the Raichu deck. But the pace as which I can make progress towards these it's abysmally, unenjoyingly slow and something I haven't experienced in any other digital TCG.

After sparking a few characters at the start of the year, It's taken me the best part of the last 9 months to get enough currency so that I will be able to spark for a single character when it comes to Christmas/New Year with 300 rolls.

Commentaire : I've been playing MS since release and I can build almost any deck, when I started playing I got all the cards I needed just by playing (in fact the first 140/200 cards were just free, period) and now with good resource management I still can play many decks. I bought 3/4 seasons pass to be fair. Sure, I can't play the full meta of decks, but I can play 3 or 4 of them, and with replacements I do can play the full meta

This game has a bigger cardpool and decks are formed by 20 cards instead of 12 so I think it's going to be way harder to build and maintain meta decks

Commentaire : The only way that comparison would be remotely fair is if you compare it to someone who started playing snap day 1 like you are doing with pocket.

I played snap on release and had the full first collection without spending a cent, just by playing the game.

Obviously you cant expect someone to get into a years old gacha and have access to much that has been released since day 1. I didnt play much snap since the first 2 colections, but that game is ridiculously more f2p than pocket.

Once you finish all events / story / 1 time rewards in pocket, you will see how it is just like every other gacha game.

Personally i think having 3 different banners (packs) on release is a huge L for pocket. They should make basic prints of every card way easier to access and just make special arts way rarer. Either that or cut in half the number of medals needed to craft a card.

(fingers crossed that the trade function is actualy good when its in place)

Worst case scenario, you need to pull 200 packs 3x to get the UR you need 3 of if you are unlucky, and there is nothing like luckying out and getting all you need from a bunch of packs, because once you pull the UR you need, it will be removed from the poll until you either reset the pack count, or go all the way through the 200 packs so it resets by itself.

Also, every new archetype / meta decks released will force you to dig through old packs to get 2 or 3 cards (more often than not, multiple copies, forcing you to reset those boxes too), and the free currency you get is not enough to go through the New pack not even once, let alone 3x, let alone going through old boxes too..

Ils ont deux événements en cours, le premier est d'une pauvreté incroyable, le deuxième est un peu plus sympa mais demande d'avoir déjà un certain nombre de cartes (la quantité de boosters offert au début permet de les avoir largement) pour être faisable entièrement 

Le système de combat est simple, je ne sais pas si il suit les mêmes règles que le jeu normal ou si il a été simplifié pour rentrer sur mobile vu que je n'y ai jamais joué.


Je pense que c'est un jeu qui occupera les curieux occasionnels pendant 1 à 2 semaines max avant que l'assechement des booster gratuits et la flemme du "farming" quotidien ne se fasse sentir.
Pour les fans de pokémon peut-être que ça prendra un peu plus de temps et les fan de tcg ont sûrement mieux sur le marché et ont probablement déjà passé leur chemin.

Ce marché est sur saturé, beaucoup de gens n'ont pas le temps de faire des daily sur 5 jeux différents donc les jeux les plus anciens ou venant de studio qui ont déja fait leurs preuves seront privilégiés.

Pourquoi j'irais sur un jeu qui va me demander des mois de time gating avant de pouvoir jouer proprement alors que j'ai déja passé ce grind sur plusieurs jeux et que j'en ai aussi pas mal qui n'ont pas ce grind?

Les jeux c'est pour s'amuser, pas pour avoir l'impression d'avoir un deuxième taff

Commentaire : Game is very polished and fun for what it is- but won’t be for everyone. 

You get two free packs of 5 cards per day. That’s enough to build a good deck in a week or two. I’ve been playing the soft launch this past month, and have two top meta decks and complete a decent amount of the collection. 

Battle is currently not the main focus- seems to be collecting instead. In the future there will be ranked mode and battle events so we’ll see. Battles are much simplified compared to regular TCG, even from the original base set. Games are quick. 

Very easy learning curve even for someone who hasn’t played a TCG before. Hope to see more events and complexity and trading down the line!

Commentaire : It’s well presented but feels really underbaked.

The cards don’t look as nice as Marvel Snap and don’t make use of the gyroscope, so they feel ‘flat’ on the screen and you have to move them around with your finger.

There appears to be an upgrade mechanic for duplicates but it seems like it only adds a little sparkle effect to the card. Nothing like Marvel Snap where they become 3D and animated.

It doesn’t explain the rarity scale for those new to Pokémon cards.

It didn’t launch with trading and the battles are extremely basic.

So, a good start I guess but not really any substance to it right now.
